    "text": "Context and justification of research\nSatelligence currently employs cloud computing, specifically Kubernetes, to process extensive volumes of satellite imagery amounting to terabytes. While this processing workflow currently runs smoothly, the company’s data team faces challenges when going deeper into the analysis and accessing intermediate results due to the big nature of this data (Satelligence, 2023). Scholars have defined big data as datasets characterized by their high Volume, Velocity, and Variety, which makes it paramount to use advanced processing and analytics techniques to derive relevant insights (Giri and Lone, 2014). In the specific case of Satelligence, their datasets can be categorized as big data due to their: High volume (Terabytes of satellite images processed every day), high velocity (Near – real time processing of these images) and high variety (Imagery coming from different sensors and regions). All these datasets are a specific case of big data: Big Geodata.\n\nSignificance of the topic\nIn the past decades there has been a rapid increase in the amount and size of geospatial information that can be accessed. Nowadays, more than 150 satellites orbit the earth collecting thousands of images every single day (Zhao et al., 2021). This has made data handling and the introduction of spatial data infrastructures (SDIs) paramount when working with such big datasets.\nTraditionally, SDIs have served to ease the accessibility, integration and analysis of spatial data (Rajabifard and Williamson, 2001). However, in practice SDIs have been built upon technologies that focus on data preservation rather than accessibility (Durbha et al., 2023). Due to this, an important shift is underway towards more cloud-based SDIs. These platforms need the emergence of new technologies that prioritize seamless access to cloud-stored data, efficient discovery services that ensure the easy location of extensive spatial data, and data visualization interfaces where multiple datasets can be depicted.\n\nCloud-based data storage\nSpatial data, just like any other type of data, can be catalogued into structured and unstructured data. Structured datasets are often organized and follow a specific structure (i.e. A traditional table with rows (objects) and columns (features)). On the other hand, unstructured data does not have a predefined structure (e.g. Satellite imagery and Time series data) (Mishra and Misra, 2017). The management of structured data has witnessed substantial advancements, making it straightforward to handle it systematically using, for instance, relational databases (i.e. With the help of Structured Query Language (SQL)) (Kaufmann and Meier, 2023). In contrast, due to the additional challenges associated with the handling of unstructured data, the developments in this area have taken a longer time to appear.\nThe emergence of cloud-based archives has been one of the main advancements for unstructured data management during the last decades. In the specific case of geo-spatial data, it has allowed to store terabytes of unstructured data (i.e. Satellite imagery) on the cloud and access it through the network. However, the necessity transmitting data across networks to access it makes it essential to develop new data formats suited for such purposes (Durbha et al., 2023).\nCloud-Optimized GeoTIFFs (COGs) are an example of data formats that have been created to ease the access of data stored in the cloud. They improve the readability by including the metadata in the initial bytes of the file stored and storing different image tiles for different scales. These characteristics make COGs heavier than traditional image formats, however, they also greatly enhance accessibility by enabling the selective transfer of only the necessary tiles (Durbha et al., 2023).\nAnother cloud native data format that has gained popularity recently is Zarr. This data format and python library focuses on the cloud-optimization of n-dimensional arrays. Zarr differently than COGs store the metadata separately from the data chunks. Normally, using external JSON files (Durbha et al., 2023).\n\n\nData discovery services\nA discovery service widely used for the exploration of big geodata (e.g. COGs) is Spatio-Temporal Asset Catalog (STAC). Through the standardization of spatial data, STAC simplifies the management and discovery of big geodata (Brodeur et al., 2019). This service works by organizing the data into catalogs, collections, items, and assets that will only be read when a computation is required (Durbha et al., 2023). This feature optimizes workflows by reducing unnecessary data loading.\n\nSTAC fundamentals\nA Catalog built under STAC specifications is composed by:\n\nSTAC components\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSTAC components\nDescription\n\n\n\n\nAssets\nAn asset can be any type of data with a spatial and a temporal component.\n\n\nItems\nAn item is a GeoJSON feature with some specifications like: Time, Link to the asset (e.g. Google bucket)\n\n\nCollections\nDefines a set of common fields to describe a group of Items that share properties and metadata\n\n\nCatalogs\nContains a list of STAC collections, items or can also contain child catalogs.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nVisualization interfaces\nThe visualization of spatial data brings with it a series of challenges due to its big nature. Dynamic tiling libraries such as TiTiler have tackled multiple of these challenges by dynamically generating PNG/JPEG image tiles only when requested without reading the entire source file into memory (TiTiler, n.d.). This feature optimizes rendering of images since PNG and JPEG image file formats are more easily transferred through the web.\n\n\n\nAdded value of this research\nThis research aims to develop a STAC catalog to facilitate the discovery of diverse big geospatial datasets created by different teams within the company. Depending on the time available for the thesis, data visualization functionalities may be integrated. Moreover, the research will explore tools to efficiently manage a STAC catalog containing both static and dynamic datasets."

This baseline scenario was evaluated qualitatively by interviewing four members of two different teams in the company (i.e. The data and the operations team). To keep a balance regarding experience of the study subjects, both the newest member of each team and a member with at least three years in the company were interviewed.\nThe questions asked during the interviews were oriented towards two main topics that were covered during this internship: Spatial data discovery and spatial data visualization. For both topics, the questions were divided into questions related to raster and vector datasets. The questions included in the interview can be found in appendix ### and were meant to be open questions with multiple possible answers."

This will include:\n\nCreation of a virtual environment or Docker container with all the required packages to create a STAC catalog.\nCreation of Local STAC using sample data from the company.\nBrowse through the STAC catalog using tools like STAC browser.\n\nThe deliverable of this step will be a GitLab repository with code to create a catalog, add assets from a local directory and browse through them locally using STAC browser.\n\n\nOrganization of main STAC structure & extensions per asset\nIn this step the structure of the STAC catalog will be defined. This will involve the selection of datasets that will be referenced on the catalog, the definition of subcatalogs and/or collections to group items with similar metadata. An initial idea of the structure of the main STAC catalog can be seen on Figure 2. Initially, the creation of two different subcatalogs is proposed to keep the static and dynamic dataset separated. Moreover, the selection of the STAC extensions1 used for each dataset will be defined in this step.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 2: Initial proposed STAC structure\n\n\n\n\n\nBuild main STAC v.0.1\nThis step will focus on the building of the initial version of the main STAC catalog, once the datasets and the overall structure has been defined. It will involve the population of the catalog with STAC components following the defined structure on Section 2.3.2. Furthermote, on this step a series of validation tools will be used to check that the STAC catalog created is followins the STAC spcification. These tools are part of the python package stac-tools.\nThe deliverable of this step will be a GitLab repository with code to create a catalog, create collections, add assets from a directory on the cloud and update them.\n\n\nSet up STAC browser on GCP\nIn this step a version of the STAC Browser application will be deployed using the tools from Google Cloud Platform (GCP). This application will allow users to browse and interact with the STAC catalog through a user-friendly interface. Additionally, this step will involve the definition of resources and tools from GCP that will be employed to deploy the application. For instance, the decision of doing it through a virtual machine or on a containerized way will be made.\nThe deliverable of this step will be a the STAC browser application running on GCP.\n\n\nAutomate processes via CI pipeline\nFinally, the code to create, modify and/or deploy the STAC catalog will be merged into a continuous integration pipeline that will allow the integration of this catalog with other tools from the company. For instance, the Distributed Processing Framework (DPROF), which is satelligence’s Satellite Data Processing engine."

    "text": "Multi-format data visualization\nTo assess the performance of dynamic tiling services for visualizing Cloud Optimized GeoTIFFs (COGs) and Zarr data formats, the following approach was undertaken. A COG containing forest baseline information for the Riau region of Indonesia was used to create a series of Zarr files, each representing different overviews corresponding to various zoom levels. This preprocessing step, completed by the company prior to the study, ensured that the same data was used across both data formats, allowing for direct comparison.\nThe TiTiler-Xarray service was then customized to work with the specific folder structure of the ZARR overviews previously created. Dockerized versions of both TiTiler-Xarray (for Zarr files) and TiTiler-PgSTAC (for COG files) were deployed locally.\nPerformance was measured by recording the response times for random tile requests at zoom levels ranging from 9 to 18. Finally, to mitigate the influence of cached data on response times, each iteration used a different colormap, with a total of six colormaps employed. This methodology enabled a systematic evaluation of the performance differences between the two data formats in a geospatial visualization context.\n\nSpeed up\nThe assessment of the performance of the new Data Catalog will be measured using the baseline scenario established at the beginning of the internship and the Speed Up metric proposed by (Durbha et al., 2023):\n\\[ SpeedUp = \\frac{t_{baseline}}{t_{catalog}} \\]\nThis metric explains how much the process to access data has sped up thanks to the integration of cloud-based storage, the data catalog and the browsing interface."
