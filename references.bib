	abstract = {All over the world, organizations are increasingly considering the adoption of open source software and open data. In the geospatial domain, this is no different, and the last few decades have seen significant advances in this regard. We review the current state of open source geospatial software, focusing on the Open Source Geospatial Foundation (OSGeo) software ecosystem and its communities, as well as three kinds of open geospatial data (collaboratively contributed, authoritative and scientific). The current state confirms that openness has changed the way in which geospatial data are collected, processed, analyzed, and visualized. A perspective on future developments, informed by responses from professionals in key organizations in the global geospatial community, suggests that open source geospatial software and open geospatial data are likely to have an even more profound impact in the future.},

	abstract = {Geographic information metadata provides a detailed description of geographic information resources. Well before digital data emerged, metadata were shown in the margins of paper maps to inform the reader of the name of the map, the scale, the orientation of the magnetic North, the projection used, the coordinate systems, the legend, and so on. Metadata were used to communicate practical information for the proper use of maps. When geographic information entered the digital era with geographic information systems, metadata was also collected digitally to describe datasets and the dataset collections for various purposes. Initially, metadata were collected and saved in digital files by data producers for their own specific needs. The sharing of geographic datasets that required producers to provide metadata with the dataset to guide proper use of the dataset—map scale, data sources, extent, datum, coordinate reference system, etc. Because of issues with sharing and no common understanding of metadata requirements, the need for metadata standardization was recognized by the geographic information community worldwide. The ISO technical committee 211 was created in 1994 with the scope of standardization in the field of digital geographic information to support interoperability. In the early years of the committee, standardization of metadata was initiated for different purposes, which culminated in the ISO 19115:2003 standard. Now, there are many ISO Geographic information standards that covers the various aspect of geographic information metadata. This paper traces an illustration of the development and evolution of the requirements and international standardization activities of geographic information metadata standards, profiles and resources, and how these attest to facilitating the discovery, evaluation, and appropriate use of geographic information in various contexts.},

	abstract = {Huge amounts of remote sensing data collected from hundreds of operational satellites in conjunction with on-demand UAV based imaging products are offering unprecedented capabilities towards monitoring dynamic earth resources. However, searching for the right combination of imagery products that satisfy an application requirement is a daunting task. Earlier efforts at streamlining remote sensing data discovery include NASA’s Earth Observing System (EOS) Data and Information System (EOSDIS), USGS Global Visualization Viewer (GloVis), and several other research systems like Minnesota MapServer. These systems were built on top of metadata harvesting, indexing, keyword searching modules which were not scalable and interoperable. To address these challenges, recently the SpatioTemporal Asset Catalog (STAC) specification was developed to provide a common language to describe a range of geospatial information, so that data products can be more easily indexed and discovered. In this paper we present an highly scalable STAC API based system with spatiotemporal indexing support. Experimental evaluation shows that our spatiotemporal indexing based queries are 1000x faster than standard STAC API server.},

	abstract = {The world as we know it is changing. Economies world wide are undergoing a process ofprofound and continuing structural change, and the global village is becoming a reality driven byIT and communication technologies. With this in mind, many countries believe that they canbenefit both economically and environmentally from better management of their spatial data assetsby taking a perspective that starts at a local level and proceeds through state, national and regionallevels to global level. This has resulted in the development of the Spatial Data Infrastructure (SDI)concept at these levels.SDI is fundamentally about facilitation and coordination of the exchange and sharing ofspatial data between stakeholders from different jurisdictional levels in the spatial datacommunity. Understanding of its role and nature are important to the acceptance of the conceptand its alignment with spatial industry objectives.The aim of this paper is to present the nature and concept of spatial data infrastructures,including the SDI hierarchy, which have helped to build understanding about the importance ofthe relationships within different levels of SDIs to support the interactions and partnerships of thespatial data communities. Moreover, the paper will highlight the importance of sharing andunderstanding its special social system, followed by a discussion of the future direction of SDIs. Itis argued that by better understanding the future direction of SDIs, any SDI development can gainsupport from a wider community of both government and non-government data users andproviders.},

	abstract = {The volume of data in the world is growing very fast and generated from verity of sources like social media, sensors airline industry or scientific data in different formats. Biggest challenge is how to infer meaningful insights from such a varietyful and big data along with concern of data storage and management of fast growing data. The size of the databases used in today's enterprises has been growing at exponential rates day by day. Hence, industries requirement to quickly process and analyze the big data volumes for business decision making and customer insights has also grown exponentially. Data pouring from various sources may be can be structured or unstructured in nature. Structured data refers to a relatively well-organized information, which can be further inserted into traditional RDBMS. As Traditional RDBMS are efficient and easy queries by simple, straightforward search algorithms or SQL queries. In contrast to structured data, unstructured data can be considered as information, which does not, comes in a pre-defined data format, well organized data storage model, or cannot be stored well into relational tables. It is assumed to be fastest growing type of data, e.g. image, sensors data, web chats, social networking messaging data, video, documents, log files, and email data. There are many techniques and software available, which can process and provide efficient storage of unstructured data and help organization to perform analytics on unstructured data. Unstructured data does not well-organized and not stored in predefined manner e.g. logs, web chats. The variety and on ordered nature of data makes storage methods and structure makes execution a time and resource-consuming affair. Advancement into technology has open floodgates to push huge volume of unstructured type of data. Multimedia data is one of the example of unstructured big data, which spans all over the Internet. This needs high execution capability to extract useful information. Rapid processing of multimedia data such as video is important for e.g. criminal investigations, surveillance monitoring, news analysis, sports analytics domain, emotion extraction, etc. Hence, analysis of multimedia data in minimum timeframe is one of the latest research areas. Therefore, we have researched techniques for analyzing unstructured data to extract meaningful information hidden in the big data. In addition, we will describe about various techniques and software used to Manage, process unstructured big data in efficient manner, and increases the performance of complexity analysis.},
