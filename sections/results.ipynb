These steps are summarized on @fig-baseline and show how complex and time consuming the process of discovering and visualizing spatial data can be for a Satelligence employee nowadays.

        "When asked about the recurrent patterns on the interviews undertaken to define the baseline scenario, ChatGPT found four main topics:\n",

        "- There is a high uncertainty on the location of datasets and a high dependency on colleagues to find them.\n",
        "- Multiple sources and locations of data.\n",

        "- Use of specific tools and methods for different datasets.\n",

        "-   High dependency on colleagues.\n",
        "-   Disorganized structure of Google Storage Buckets.\n",
        "-   Data familiarity helps users locate data quicker.\n",
        "-   Data location is dependent on recurrent work with a specific dataset.\n",
        "-   Not intuitive naming of repositories (e.g. Blockchain for supply chain data, internet for compliance data, etc.).\n",
        "-   Not one place where all existing data can be found.\n",
