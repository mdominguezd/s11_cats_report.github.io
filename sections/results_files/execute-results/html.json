These steps are summarized on @fig-baseline and show how complex and time consuming the process of discovering and visualizing spatial data can be for a Satelligence employee nowadays. Moreover, the steps followed were categorized in four classes depending on how much time is generally spent carrying out.\n\n![Baseline workflow](img/Baseline_data_discovery_workflow.png){#fig-baseline width=\"100%\"}\n\nThe major pitfalls found on the process of data discovery in the company could be summarized in:\n\n-   High dependency on colleagues.\n-   Disorganized structure of Google Storage Buckets.\n-   Experienced study subjects would find the data location faster.\n-   Data discovery also dependent on recurrent work with a specific dataset (Google Console highlighted links).\n-   Not intuitive naming of repositories.\n\n## Service integration\n\n*Explain here how eoAPI uses multiple services, how each of them helps S11 in their data discovery and vizz tasks, and how did I manage to deploy it*\n\nKubernetes\n\nSTAC-API, pgSTAC, TiTiler\n\n### Data discovery improvement\n\nFlowchart with STAC\n\n## Performance of multi-format data visualization\n\nTiTiler-PgSTAC & TiTiler-xarray\n\n### Raster formats\n\n\n\n\nThe comparison of visualization speeds with TiTiler-xarray for Zarr datasets and TiTiler-PgSTAC for COGs are presented on @fig-format-comp. In the figure it can be obesrved that COG tiles are requested 2.38 times faster than the same file in ZARR format.\n\n::: {#cell-fig-format-comp .cell execution_count=2}\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-display}\n![Request times depending on data format and zoom level](results_files/figure-html/fig-format-comp-output-1.png){#fig-format-comp width=634 height=436}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n### Effects of zoom level\n\n\n\nAs seen on @fig-comp-zoom, the zoom level of the map will have an effect on the time spent requesting and getting a tile from a tile server. In this study, it was found that the request times decreased by a factor of -0.013 and -0.005 per zoom level for COGs and ZARRs respectively.\n\n::: {#cell-fig-comp-zoom .cell execution_count=4}\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-display}\n![Request times depending on zoom level](results_files/figure-html/fig-comp-zoom-output-1.png){#fig-comp-zoom width=634 height=436}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\\hl{Talk about how this figure also might indicate that the way the tiles are being called by titiler xarray is not ideal?}\n\n",
